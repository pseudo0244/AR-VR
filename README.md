# 🏗️ AR/VR Blueprint Scanner

## **Overview**
The **AR/VR Blueprint Scanner** is an innovative application that allows users to **scan a 2D blueprint** using their mobile device and **convert it into a 3D model**, which can then be viewed in **Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR)**. This project bridges the gap between traditional architectural plans and immersive digital experiences, enabling architects, engineers, and designers to visualize structures in real-world environments.

---
## **Key Features**
✅ **Blueprint Scanning:** Upload or scan a 2D floor plan or architectural blueprint.  
✅ **AI-Powered Processing:** Detects walls, doors, and windows using machine learning.  
✅ **3D Model Generation:** Converts blueprints into interactive 3D models.  
✅ **Augmented Reality (AR) Support:** View the generated model in AR using a mobile device.  
✅ **Virtual Reality (VR) Compatibility:** Supports VR platforms for immersive architectural visualization.  
✅ **Web-Based Access:** Works via a browser-based WebAR/WebVR interface.  
✅ **Export Options:** Download the generated 3D model in GLTF/GLB/USDZ formats for further use.

## **Technology Stack**
### **Backend**  
- **Python (Flask/Django)** – API backend for processing blueprints.
- **OpenCV & TensorFlow** – Image processing and AI-based blueprint detection.
- **Three.js & WebXR** – 3D rendering and WebAR/WebVR support.

### **Frontend**  
- **React (or Vue.js)** – Web-based user interface.
- **A-Frame & Babylon.js** – For AR/VR interactions.
- **WebAR/WebVR API** – For immersive experiences on mobile & VR devices.

## **How It Works**
1. **Upload a Blueprint:** Users can upload a scanned image or capture a blueprint using their mobile device.
2. **Processing:** AI processes the blueprint, detects walls, doors, and windows, and generates a 3D model.
3. **3D Visualization:** The processed model is rendered using WebGL and Three.js.
4. **AR/VR Viewing:** Users can interact with the 3D model in AR using WebAR or explore it in a VR environment.
5. **Export:** The model can be downloaded in various formats for further use in 3D modeling software.

## **Use Cases**
🏢 **Architecture & Construction** – Visualize floor plans before construction.  
📐 **Interior Design** – Experiment with layouts in real-world space.  
🏡 **Real Estate** – Enhance property showcases with interactive 3D models.  
📚 **Education** – Teach students about architecture and 3D design.
